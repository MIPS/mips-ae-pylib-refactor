# Atlas Explorer Python API - Optimization & Refactoring TODO

## 📝 DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION POLICY

**⚠️ UPDATED DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY:**
- **TODO.md**: Keep focused on current and upcoming work only
- **claude_done/**: Comprehensive documentation for completed phases
  - Each completed phase gets its own detailed markdown file
  - Includes accomplishments, metrics, technical details, and lessons learned
  - Preserves project history and decision context
  - See `claude_done/README.md` for documentation standards

**For each completed work session:**
1. Update TODO.md with current progress
2. Create/update phase completion document in `claude_done/`
3. Remove completed details from TODO.md to keep it focused
4. Reference completed work via links to phase documents

This strategy maintains project continuity while keeping working documents manageable.
