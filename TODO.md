## 🎯 PRIMARY MISSION: DEPRECATE MONOLITHIC DESIGN

**Core Objective:** Replace the monolithic `atlasexplorer.py` (1,056 lines) with a clean, modular Python library architecture for better maintainability and customer experience.

**Legacy Target for Removal:**
- `atlasexplorer/atlasexplorer.py` - 1,056 lines of monolithic code containing 5 classes:
  - `Experiment` - Experiment management and execution
  - `SummaryReport` - Report analysis and metrics
  - `AtlasConstants` - Configuration constants  
  - `AtlasConfig` - Configuration management
  - `AtlasExplorer` - Main API client

**Modular Replacement Architecture:**
```
atlasexplorer/
├── __init__.py          # Clean API exports & backward compatibility
├── core/               # Core functionality (config, client, experiment)
├── security/           # Encryption and authentication 
├── network/            # HTTP client and API communication
├── analysis/           # ELF parsing and report analysis
├── cli/                # Command-line interface
└── utils/              # Exceptions and utilities
```

**Migration Strategy:** Complete functional parity in modular components, then deprecate and remove monolithic file.

## 📝 DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION POLICY

**Documentation Structure:**
- **TODO.md**: Current work focus on monolithic migration
- **claude_done/**: Completed phase documentation and migration progress
- Each phase documents progress toward modular architecture goal

**Migration Tracking:** Every session moves us closer to eliminating the 1,056-line monolith.
