# Atlas Explorer Python API - Optimization & Refactoring TODO

## 📝 DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION POLICY

**⚠️ UPDATED DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY:**
- **TODO.md**: Keep focused on current and upcoming work only
- **claude_done/**: Comprehensive documentation for completed phases
  - Each completed phase gets its own detailed markdown file
  - Includes accomplishments, metrics, technical details, and lessons learned
  - Preserves project history and decision context
  - See `claude_done/README.md` for documentation standards

**For each completed work session:**
1. Update TODO.md with current progress
2. Create/update phase completion document in `claude_done/`
3. Remove completed details from TODO.md to keep it focused
4. Reference completed work via links to phase documents

This strategy maintains project continuity while keeping working documents manageable.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (Phase 1.3)

### Priority 1: Comprehensive Test Coverage (2-3 days)
```python
# Achieve >90% test coverage across all modules
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=atlasexplorer --cov-report=html
# Focus areas:
# - Edge cases in experiment lifecycle
# - Error handling in cloud communication
# - File system operations and cleanup
```

### Priority 2: End-to-End Integration Tests (1-2 days)
```python
# Create full workflow validation tests
tests/integration/
├── test_full_experiment_workflow.py
├── test_cloud_platform_integration.py
└── test_cross_module_interactions.py
```

### Priority 3: Performance Benchmarking (1 day)
```python
# Establish performance baselines
def test_experiment_creation_performance():
def test_large_workload_handling():
def test_concurrent_experiment_limits():
```

### Priority 4: API Documentation (2 days)
```python
# Complete docstring coverage with examples
# Generate Sphinx documentation
# Create user migration guide
```

### Priority 5: CI/CD Pipeline (1 day)
```yaml
# Setup automated testing and validation
.github/workflows/
├── test.yml
├── type-check.yml
└── security-scan.yml
```

### Success Criteria for Phase 1.3:
- [ ] >90% test coverage across all modules
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
