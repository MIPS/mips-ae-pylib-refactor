## 🎯 Purpose

This documentation strategy provides:

1. **Project Continuity** - Comprehensive record of what was accomplished and why
2. **Knowledge Transfer** - Detailed technical context for team members
3. **Decision Tracking** - Rationale behind architectural and implementation choices
4. **Progress Measurement** - Quantitative metrics demonstrating project value
5. **Future Planning** - Clear understanding of foundations laid for upcoming work

## 🔄 Maintenance

- Each phase document is created upon phase completion
- Documents are updated if significant changes affect completed work
- Cross-references are maintained between related phases
- Metrics are validated and updated as needed

This approach keeps the main TODO.md focused on current and upcoming work while preserving the rich context of completed phases in dedicated, comprehensive documents.
