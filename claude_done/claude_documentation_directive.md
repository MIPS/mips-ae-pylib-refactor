# Claude Documentation Strategy - Internal Directive

## üìù UPDATED DOCUMENTATION APPROACH

**ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS STRATEGY FOR FUTURE WORK:**

### 1. TODO.md Management
- **Keep TODO.md focused and manageable** - only current and upcoming work
- **Remove completed phase details** after documenting them properly
- **Update current progress** but don't let it become a historical archive
- **Reference completed work** via links to dedicated phase documents

### 2. Phase Completion Documentation
- **Create comprehensive phase documents** in `claude_done/` directory
- **Document EVERYTHING**: accomplishments, metrics, technical details, lessons learned
- **Use consistent structure**: see `claude_done/README.md` for standards
- **Include quantitative results**: before/after comparisons, performance metrics
- **Explain technical decisions**: why approaches were chosen, trade-offs made

### 3. Each Work Session Process
1. **Start**: Check current TODO.md for context and next actions
2. **Work**: Implement features, test, validate
3. **Document**: Update TODO.md with current progress
4. **Complete**: When phase finished, create comprehensive phase document
5. **Clean**: Remove completed details from TODO.md, add phase reference link

### 4. Documentation Standards
- **Comprehensive**: Include what was done, why, how, and impact
- **Quantitative**: Always include metrics and measurable improvements
- **Technical**: Code examples, architecture decisions, implementation details
- **Business Impact**: Developer productivity, risk mitigation, scalability
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights for future phases and team knowledge

### 5. Benefits of This Approach
- **Manageable TODO**: Stays focused on current work, not overwhelmed with history
- **Preserved Context**: Comprehensive phase docs maintain all important details
- **Better Navigation**: Easy to find specific information in dedicated documents
- **Team Continuity**: Rich documentation enables seamless team transitions
- **Decision Tracking**: Technical choices and rationale preserved for future reference

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION COMMITMENT

**I will ALWAYS:**
1. Keep TODO.md concise and focused on current/upcoming work
2. Create detailed phase completion documents in `claude_done/`
3. Document quantitative improvements and technical decisions
4. Explain business impact and lessons learned
5. Reference completed work via links, not inline details
6. Update documentation strategy as project evolves

This approach ensures project continuity while maintaining manageable working documents.
