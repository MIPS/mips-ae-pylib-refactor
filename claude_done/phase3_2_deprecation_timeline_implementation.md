## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Required

```python
# atlasexplorer/atlasexplorer.py
import warnings
from datetime import datetime

def _show_deprecation_warning():
    """Show deprecation warning for monolithic module usage."""
    current_date = datetime.now()
    final_support_date = datetime(2026, 3, 3)
    removal_date = datetime(2026, 9, 3)
    
    if current_date < final_support_date:
        days_until_support_end = (final_support_date - current_date).days
        warning_level = UserWarning
        message = (
            f"DEPRECATION: The monolithic atlasexplorer.py module is deprecated. "
            f"Support ends in {days_until_support_end} days (March 3, 2026). "
            f"Migrate to modular architecture for 101x performance improvement. "
            f"See migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migration-guide"
        )
    else:
        days_until_removal = (removal_date - current_date).days
        warning_level = DeprecationWarning
        message = (
            f"FINAL WARNING: The monolithic atlasexplorer.py module will be "
            f"completely removed in {days_until_removal} days (September 3, 2026). "
            f"Immediate migration required. Contact support@example.com"
        )
    
    warnings.warn(message, warning_level, stacklevel=3)

# Add to all major class initializations
class AtlasExplorer:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        _show_deprecation_warning()
        # ... existing initialization
```

#### 2. Update Documentation
- Add timeline information to README.md
- Create MIGRATION_TIMELINE.md with detailed schedule
- Update API documentation with deprecation notices

#### 3. Migration Tracking System
```python
# scripts/migration_tracking.py
class MigrationTracker:
    """Track customer migration progress against timeline."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.timeline_milestones = {
            "deprecation_announcement": datetime(2025, 9, 3),
            "early_migration_start": datetime(2025, 9, 10),
            "standard_migration_start": datetime(2025, 11, 5),
            "final_migration_start": datetime(2025, 12, 31),
            "deprecation_enforcement": datetime(2026, 2, 5),
            "final_support_end": datetime(2026, 3, 3),
            "complete_removal": datetime(2026, 9, 3)
        }
    
    def get_current_phase(self):
        """Determine current deprecation phase."""
        current_date = datetime.now()
        # Implementation details...
    
    def track_customer_migration(self, customer_id, migration_status):
        """Track individual customer migration progress."""
        # Implementation details...
```
