  - Community examples showcasing modular benefits
  - Customer success stories from early adopters
  - Open source contributions highlighting modular patterns
  - Developer community engagement and feedback collection

### Phase 3.3: Systematic Legacy Reduction (Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Progressively reduce reliance on monolithic file

#### 3.3.1 Legacy Usage Monitoring
- **Objective:** Track and reduce legacy monolithic usage over time
- **Approach:**
  - Automated reporting on legacy API usage
  - Customer-specific migration progress tracking
  - Identification of remaining legacy dependencies
  - Proactive outreach to customers still using legacy components

#### 3.3.2 Escalated Deprecation Warnings
- **Objective:** Increase urgency of migration while maintaining support
- **Strategy:**
  - Progressive warning severity increases
  - Clear timeline communication for legacy sunset
  - Preservation of functionality during transition period
  - Emergency support for customers with migration challenges

#### 3.3.3 Legacy Code Isolation
- **Objective:** Prepare monolithic file for complete removal
- **Steps:**
  - Move legacy code to clearly marked deprecated modules
  - Remove any remaining internal dependencies on legacy code
  - Ensure modular components are completely independent
  - Validate that legacy removal will not break modular functionality

### Phase 3.4: Monolithic File Removal (Week 3)
**Goal:** Complete elimination of legacy monolithic architecture

#### 3.4.1 Final Migration Validation
- **Objective:** Confirm all customers have viable migration paths
- **Requirements:**
  - Legacy usage below acceptable threshold (e.g., <5% of traffic)
  - No critical customers dependent on legacy-only features
  - Emergency migration support available for stragglers
  - Rollback plan available if unforeseen issues arise

#### 3.4.2 Legacy File Removal
- **Objective:** Delete the monolithic `atlasexplorer.py` file
- **Process:**
  - Final backup of legacy code for historical reference
  - Removal of 1,056 lines of monolithic code
  - Cleanup of any remaining legacy imports or references
  - Validation that all tests pass with legacy removed

#### 3.4.3 Clean Architecture Validation
- **Objective:** Confirm pure modular architecture is fully functional
- **Validation:**
  - Complete test suite execution with 100% pass rate
  - Performance benchmarking of pure modular system
  - Customer acceptance testing of final modular-only library
  - Documentation updates reflecting clean architecture
