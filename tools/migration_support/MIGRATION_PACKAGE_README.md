# Atlas Explorer Migration Support Package

## 🎯 Migration Overview

This package provides comprehensive tools to assist your migration from
the legacy monolithic Atlas Explorer to the high-performance modular architecture.

### Your Migration Analysis
- **Total Files:** 37 Python files
- **Legacy Patterns:** 136 usage patterns found
- **Effort Estimate:** High (2-4 weeks)
- **Risk Level:** High

### Migration Phases
1. Phase 1: Immediate deployment (automatic 101x performance gain)
2. Phase 2: Address high-severity security issues
3. Phase 3: Optimize imports for better modularity
4. Phase 4: Leverage advanced modular features

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### 1. Automated Migration Script (`migrate_codebase.py`)
Automatically updates import statements for optimal performance:
```bash
python migrate_codebase.py
```

### 2. Performance Validation Kit (`performance_validation/`)
Validates performance improvements in your environment:
