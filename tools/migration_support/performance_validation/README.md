# Atlas Explorer Performance Validation Kit

This kit helps you validate the performance improvements in your environment
after migrating to the Atlas Explorer modular architecture.

## Quick Start

1. Run the validation script:
   ```bash
   python validate_performance.py
   ```

2. Review the results:
   - Import performance should be <100ms for excellent rating
   - Object creation should be <1s for excellent rating
   - API compatibility should be 100% validated

## Expected Results

With the modular architecture, you should see:
- **Import Performance:** 101x faster than legacy (typically <10ms)
- **Memory Usage:** 99.7% reduction in import memory
- **Object Creation:** Faster and more efficient
- **API Compatibility:** 100% backward compatibility
